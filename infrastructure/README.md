# Infrastructure

This contains the scripts necessary to hoist the entire services API and forecasting API

The actual scripts here are copied from the web, and are not yet sufficient.

Requirements are

* A p2.large instance 
* A standard instance for a webserver
* An S3 bucket
* A Postgres DB

Load balancing, multi-AZ, failover: these are all unnecessary
